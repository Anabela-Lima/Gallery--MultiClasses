        // 3.1. Generate Constructors---------------------------------------------------------------
/*

      Why?   when we create objects, we say that they are of the class type implying they have the characteristics
             the class, right?

             A Constructor is responsible for passing the characteristics of the class to the object.

             so we need to create constructors in every class file so that when we create a new object, they are by
             definition part of that class, since they have the class characteristics.

        // 3.2 . Getters and Setters----------------------------------------------------------------


/*
         1. A customer has a name, and a wallet amount
         2. A gallery has a name, a till amount, and a collection of artwork
         3. An Artwork has a title, an artists, a price and an nft

          Generate Getters and Setters for all of these (+ the artist too) in their respective files- done

    /*
          Note: Gallery class has format: (string, int, array list) and therefore so should objects belonging to the class.
             In Gallery.java  I  removed array list from constructor, so it wouldn't pass the characteristic of
             array list to the gallery object that I created here (i.e,. gallery1) that way I don't have to write an array
             list) since im not passing the arraylist characteristic from the gallery class, onto the object.
             I want to be able to add Artwork to the gallery manually instead. I did the same thing with the artist
            the artwork for the artist's collection will be added manually

/*
         I also need to create a method to increase the till amount- This must be written in the Gallery class
         because only that class has access to characteristic:till amount if  I try to call till amount from another
         class it won't work because those characteristics are set private meaning only available to class in which
         they are created in.
